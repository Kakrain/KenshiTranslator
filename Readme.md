‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Extract ‚Äì The tool reads your .mod file and extracts all translatable strings into a dictionary file (.dict).

Translate ‚Äì The extracted dictionary can be auto-translated with providers (Google Translate, etc.) or manually edited.

Apply ‚Äì The dictionary is merged back into the .mod, replacing the original strings with their translated versions.

Backup ‚Äì Your original .mod is preserved as mod.backup in case you want to restore it.

This workflow ensures you can iterate on translations safely without ever losing your original data.
